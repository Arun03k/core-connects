# Security Policy

## Repository Access Control

### Main Branch Protection

This repository enforces strict access control on the `main` branch to ensure security and code quality:

- ✅ **Only the repository owner** (`Arun03k`) can push directly to the `main` branch
- ❌ **External contributors** must use pull requests for all contributions
- 🔒 **Production deployments** are restricted to repository owner only
- 🔍 **All changes** to main branch must pass security and quality checks

### Contribution Guidelines

#### For External Contributors

1. **Fork the repository** or create a feature branch
2. **Make your changes** on your branch (not main)
3. **Create a pull request** targeting the main branch
4. **Wait for review** and approval from repository owner
5. **Repository owner** will merge and deploy after approval

#### For Repository Owner

1. Can push directly to main branch
2. Responsible for reviewing and merging pull requests
3. Authorized to trigger production deployments
4. Must ensure all security checks pass

## Security Measures

### Automated Enforcement

Our CI/CD pipeline automatically enforces these policies:

- **Owner Verification**: All deployment workflows verify the actor is the repository owner
- **Branch Protection**: Direct pushes to main by non-owners are blocked
- **Security Scans**: Automated security scanning on all code changes
- **Access Logging**: All access attempts are logged and monitored

### Pipeline Security

- 🔐 **Deployment Authorization**: Only owner can deploy to production
- 🔍 **Security Scanning**: Trivy and CodeQL scans on all changes
- 📋 **Audit Trail**: All deployments and changes are logged
- 🚨 **Failure Alerts**: Security policy violations are immediately flagged

## Reporting Security Issues

### Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. **Contact the repository owner** directly via GitHub
3. **Provide detailed information** about the vulnerability
4. **Allow time** for the issue to be addressed before disclosure
