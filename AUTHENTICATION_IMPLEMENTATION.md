- Common password rejection (50+ blocked passwords)
- Repeated character and sequence detection
- Secure password suggestion generation
- Bcrypt with configurable rounds (default: 12)

### 🌐 Enhanced API Endpoints

#### Authentication Routes (`/api/auth/`)
- `POST /login` - Enhanced login with rate limiting (5 attempts/5 min)
- `POST /register` - Registration with email verification (3 reg/10 min)  
- `POST /refresh` - Access token refresh using refresh tokens
- `POST /logout` - Token revocation and session cleanup
- `GET /verify` - Enhanced token validation
- `GET /verify-email/<token>` - Email address verification
- `POST /resend-verification` - Resend verification email
- `POST /forgot-password` - Password reset email dispatch
- `POST /reset-password` - Secure password reset with tokens

### 📊 Security Features Implemented

#### Password Requirements
- ✅ Minimum 8 characters (configurable)
- ✅ At least one uppercase letter
- ✅ At least one lowercase letter
- ✅ At least one number
- ✅ At least one special character
- ✅ Rejection of 50+ common passwords
- ✅ No common sequences (123, abc, qwe, etc.)
- ✅ Limited repeated characters (max 3 consecutive)

#### Token Security
- ✅ Separate access and refresh tokens
- ✅ Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- ✅ Long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
- ✅ Unique token IDs (JTI) for tracking
- ✅ Token blacklisting on logout/password change
- ✅ Token validation with user status checks

#### Rate Limiting & Protection
- ✅ Login attempts: 5 per 5 minutes per IP
- ✅ Registration: 3 per 10 minutes per IP
- ✅ Account lockout: 5 failed attempts = 30-minute lockout
- ✅ Endpoint-specific rate limiting
- ✅ IP and user-based tracking

#### Email Security
- ✅ Email verification required for full account access
- ✅ Verification tokens expire in 24 hours
- ✅ Password reset tokens expire in 1 hour
- ✅ Secure token generation with JWT
- ✅ One-time token usage enforcement

## 🔄 Backwards Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backwards compatibility with existing frontend code while adding enhanced security features. All existing endpoints continue to work with improved validation and security.

## 🎯 Security Compliance

This implementation meets and exceeds the requirements specified in Issue #3:

- ✅ **Password Security**: Advanced validation with 8 security requirements
- ✅ **JWT Implementation**: Dual token system with proper expiry
- ✅ **Email Verification**: Complete verification workflow  
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Multiple layers of protection
- ✅ **Account Security**: Lockout and session management
- ✅ **Input Validation**: XSS and injection protection
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Security logging and monitoring

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens and logs
- Minimal memory footprint for validation
- Fast bcrypt operations with optimized rounds
- Connection pooling for email services

## 🔮 Future Enhancements Ready

The architecture supports easy extension for:
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA/2FA)
- OAuth integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)  
- Advanced role-based permissions
- Session management across devices
- Suspicious activity detection
- Password policy customization

## ✨ Issue #3 Status: **COMPLETE** ✅

All requirements from the GitHub issue have been successfully implemented with additional security enhancements. The authentication system is now production-ready with enterprise-grade security features.
