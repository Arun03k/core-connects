## How to Use These Templates

### Option 1: Use GitHub Issue Templates (Recommended)
1. These files are already configured as GitHub issue templates
2. When creating a new issue in GitHub, select the appropriate template
3. The template will auto-populate the issue form
4. Fill in any additional details specific to your implementation

### Option 2: Manual Issue Creation
1. Copy the content from the appropriate `.md` file
2. Create a new GitHub issue
3. Paste the content as the issue description
4. Add the specified labels manually
5. Assign to appropriate team members

### Option 3: Bulk Issue Creation
Use the provided issue creation script (see `create-all-issues.md`) to create all issues at once.
