## 🚀 How to Create Issues

### Method 1: GitHub Issue Templates (Recommended)
1. Go to [New Issue](https://github.com/Arun03k/core-connects/issues/new/choose)
2. Select the appropriate template
3. Fill in any additional details
4. Submit the issue

### Method 2: Manual Copy-Paste
1. Open files in `issues-to-create/` directory
2. Copy the title and content from each issue file
3. Create new GitHub issues manually
4. Add the specified labels

### Method 3: Bulk Creation with GitHub CLI
```bash
# See .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/create-all-issues.md for scripts
gh issue create --repo Arun03k/core-connects --title "..." --body-file "..." --label "..."
```

3. **Implement backend changes** before frontend (where applicable)
4. **Update documentation** as features are implemented
5. **Create comprehensive tests** for all new functionality
6. **Submit pull request** with proper review process
